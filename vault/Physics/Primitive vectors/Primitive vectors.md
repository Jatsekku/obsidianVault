## Definition
 Primitive vectors are vectors that defines primitive lattice. 
 If we move from point $r$ to point $r'$ using translation vector with integer coefficients the atom arrangement will stay the same.

$$r' = r + u_{1} a_{1} + u_{2} a_{2} + u_{3} a_{3}$$
 where:
- $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$ - primitive vectors 
- $u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}$ - any integer numbers
