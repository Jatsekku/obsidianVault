## Definition
It's special type of primitive cell which volume encapsulates all points in space which are closer to associated lattice point than to any other.

## Construction 
It may be constructed by drawing line between selected lattice point and it's closest neighbors and applying perpendicular bisector lines on them. The area/volume closed within the bisector lines is the area/volume of the Wigner-Seitz cell.
