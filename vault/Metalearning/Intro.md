## Some strategies
- Distributed practice
- [[#Practice testing]]
- Interleaved Practice
- Elaborative Interrogation
- Self-Explanation
- Dual Coding

## Practice testing
- Also known as **retrieval practice**
- It's based on recalling information from memory 
  using **tests, quizzes, exams**
- Has higher cognitive effort which enhance **memory consolidation** and create **stronger neural pathways**
### Evidence
 1. The critical role of retrieval practice in long-term retention

### Key takeaways:
- Providing the correct answer after a retrieval attempt increases the mnemonic benefits of testing [1]
- Feedback given after the entire test boosted final performance even more. [1] 
	=> Delayed feedback yield better performance than immediate feedback
